    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Glory, a penultimate-year (4th-year) Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate student at the Federal University of Technology, Minna. 
        I’m also an independent researcher with ML Collective and a Research Intern at the IEEE Skill-Up Technology Hub at the University of Chichester. 
        Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Jossou Research Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), mentored by DongHun Ryu and supervised by Erricmore Jossou.
        My research focuses on the design, control, and learning of autonomous systems under resource constraints. 
        I aim to create intelligent systems that can adapt their behavior efficiently in complex, dynamic environments by integrating methods from machine learning, deep learning, and adaptive control. 
        Specifically, I explore techniques such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model compression, knowledge distillation, and embedded machine learning to enable compute- and energy-efficient scaling of autonomous systems.
