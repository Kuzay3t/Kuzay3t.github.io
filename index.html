    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Glory, a penultimate-year (4th-year) Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate at the Federal University of Technology, Minna. 
        I am an independent researcher with ML Collective and a Research Intern at the IEEE Skill-Up Technology Hub at the University of Chichester. 
        Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Jossou Research Group at MIT, mentored by DongHun Ryu and supervised by Erricmore Jossou.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My research focuses on the design, control, and learning of autonomous systems under resource constraints. 
        I explore parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model compression, knowledge distillation, adaptive control, and embedded machine learning to enable compute- and energy-efficient intelligent systems. 
        My goal is to build autonomous systems that adapt robustly in complex, dynamic environments while operating on limited hardware.
    </p>
